# Patient-matching
## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. All the libraries using the command
 ```console
pip install -r requirements. txt
```
3. Anthropic API key (for generating natural language explanations)

# Setup
## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First clone the repository. The files and folders are structured in a way, to run the main code and the unit tests as well.

## Step 2: Prepare you data
Place the following CSV files in the main directory:

allergies.csv\
careplans.csv\
conditions.csv\
encounters.csv\
immunizations.csv\
medications.csv\
observations.csv\
patients.csv\
procedures.csv

Also, in the folder "NCT0099xxxx" place all trial XML files.

## Step 3: Set Up the API Key
You will need Anthropicâ€™s Claude API to generate natural language explanations. There is a variable in the for storing your API key.

# Data Sources
For the patient data (with conditions), various csv files are used as input. This is from [synthea](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads) website, with only the latest 100 data samples. With respect to the clinical trial data, when I tried to access the clinicaltrials.gov API there were issues as it was migrated. So from the [website](https://www.trec-cds.org/2022.html#documents) provided in the google docs, part 1 of the corpus was considered. 
From this it is evident that only a small amount of data was considered. This is due to the fact that I was not able to make use of powerful hardware/systems. Even with google colab pro, the notebook kept crasing due to the large amount of data. 

# Usage Instructions
## Step 1: Run the Python Script
To run the script, ensure that all the CSV and XML files are in place, and execute the following command:
```console
python main.py
```

## Step 2: Check Results
The results will be written to two output files:

1. eligible_trials.xlsx: An Excel file that lists each patient and the clinical trials they are eligible for, along with the eligibility criteria they met.
2. results.json: A JSON file that stores the eligibility results for each patient, including detailed explanations for why they are or are not eligible for specific trials.

# How It Works
## Data Merging:
1. Data from several CSV files (e.g., allergies, careplans, conditions, encounters, etc.) is merged based on common PATIENT columns.
2. Duplicate entries are removed, and unnecessary columns are dropped.

## Trial Matching:
1. The system parses clinical trial data in XML format.
2. For each patient, the system checks whether they meet the age and condition criteria for each trial.

## Explanations:
After checking eligibility, the system generates a natural language explanation for each patient using the Claude API.

## Output:
The results, including the list of eligible trials per patient, are saved in an Excel file and a JSON file.
